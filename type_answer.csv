Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What is the ""Fortress Balance Sheet"" in a technical architecture context?,It translates to **Operational Resilience**. It dictates that systems must prioritize survival and recovery over cost efficiency, necessitating active-active redundancy to withstand ""Black Swan"" events and ensure the bank can settle payments even during a catastrophe.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What is ""Gaia"" in the JP Morgan ecosystem?,JP Morgan's internal **Private Cloud** (PaaS) built on Cloud Foundry/Kubernetes. It is used to host core ledgers, high-sensitivity data (MNPI), and applications requiring strict data sovereignty within the firm's firewall.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,When should a Solutions Analyst choose **AWS** (Public Cloud) over **Gaia**?,For ""burst"" compute needs (e.g., overnight risk simulations), highly elastic workloads, or customer-facing applications that benefit from global edge caching, provided the data is not restricted MNPI.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What is **Kinexys**?,The rebrand of JP Morgan's blockchain unit (formerly **Onyx**). It represents the strategic shift from ""experimental"" to ""industrial"" digital assets, focusing on tokenized deposits (JPM Coin) and programmable payments for institutional clients.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,How does **JPM Coin (JPMD)** differ from a stablecoin (like USDC)?,JPM Coin is a **Tokenized Deposit**, meaning it is a direct liability of the bank and carries the full weight of JPMC's balance sheet. Stablecoins are asset-backed and carry counterparty risk of the issuer.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What is the **""Singleness of Money""** principle?,The regulatory requirement that a digital token (like JPM Coin) must always be exchangeable at par ($1:$1) with commercial bank money, ensuring fungibility and no fluctuation in value compared to traditional deposits.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What is **""LLM Suite""**?,JPMC's internal, secure gateway to Large Language Models (like GPT-4). It acts as a ""walled garden"" to prevent data leakage, allowing employees to use GenAI for productivity without exposing proprietary code or client data to the public internet.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,Define **""Agentic AI""** in the context of JPMC's 2025 strategy.,AI systems that can **execute multi-step workflows** (e.g., ""Investigate this alert, query the DB, and draft a SAR"") rather than just generating text. It shifts AI from a passive tool to an autonomous ""digital worker"" with human supervision.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What is the **""Paved Road""** concept in software delivery?,A set of standardized, pre-approved CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure patterns that automatically inherit the bank's security and compliance controls, allowing developers to deploy code without manual risk board approvals.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What are **""Programmable Payments""**?,Using smart contracts to embed logic into a payment. For example, ""Release funds ONLY when the digital Bill of Lading is verified."" This collapses reconciliation and payment execution into a single, atomic step.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What is the **""Weekend Trap""** that Kinexys helps solve?,Traditional RTGS systems (like Fedwire or Target2) often close on weekends/holidays, trapping liquidity. Kinexys allows institutional clients to move value 24/7/365 on the blockchain ledger.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What is **MNPI**?,**Material Non-Public Information**. Data that, if disclosed, could affect a company's stock price. Systems handling MNPI usually require hosting on **Gaia** (Private Cloud) with strict ""Chinese Wall"" access controls.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,Why is JPMC extending JPM Coin to public blockchains like **Base**?,To enable **Interoperability**. It allows institutional clients to settle transactions on the networks where they are already trading (DeFi/Tokenized Assets) while maintaining the safety and regulatory compliance of ""Bank Money.""
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What is the **""Unified Ledger""** concept?,A future state where tokenized **deposits** (money) and tokenized **assets** (bonds/equities) reside on the same programmable platform, enabling instant ""Delivery vs. Payment"" (DvP) and eliminating settlement risk.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What is **""Data Sovereignty""** and how does it impact cloud strategy?,The legal requirement that data remains within a specific country's borders (e.g., Saudi Arabia, EU). This often mandates using **Gaia** local instances or specific AWS regions to ensure data does not physically leave the jurisdiction.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What is the **""Blast Radius""** design principle?,Architecting systems so that a failure in one component (e.g., a payment gateway) is contained and does not cascade to bring down the entire platform. This is often achieved using ""Bulkhead"" or ""Circuit Breaker"" patterns.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,Why is **""Human-in-the-Loop"" (HITL)** critical for AI in RegTech?,Regulators require accountability. While AI (like Agentic AI) can draft a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR), a human must review and sign off on it to accept the regulatory liability, as AI cannot be held legally responsible.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What is **""Atomic Settlement""**?,The simultaneous exchange of assets and payment in a single transaction block. If one side fails, the entire transaction reverts. This eliminates counterparty settlement risk.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What is the approximate annual technology spend of JP Morgan?,**~$17-18 Billion**. This massive budget allows JPMC to build proprietary advantages (like Kinexys and Gaia) rather than relying solely on third-party vendors.
Day 1: Strategy, Gaia, Kinexys & AI,What is the **""Hybrid Cloud""** strategy at JPMC?,The strategic use of both **Gaia** (Private Cloud) for core/sensitive workloads and **AWS** (Public Cloud) for elastic/customer-facing workloads, optimizing for both security (Gaia) and speed/scale (AWS).
