Deck,Question,Answer
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the 'Fortress Balance Sheet' in a technical architecture context?,It translates to Operational Resilience. It dictates that systems must prioritize survival and recovery over cost efficiency; necessitating active-active redundancy to withstand Black Swan events and ensure the bank can settle payments even during a catastrophe.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is 'Gaia' in the JP Morgan ecosystem?,JP Morgan's internal Private Cloud (PaaS) built on Cloud Foundry/Kubernetes. It is used to host core ledgers; high-sensitivity data (MNPI); and applications requiring strict data sovereignty within the firm's firewall.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,When should a Solutions Analyst choose AWS (Public Cloud) over Gaia?,For 'burst' compute needs (e.g. overnight risk simulations); highly elastic workloads; or customer-facing applications that benefit from global edge caching; provided the data is not restricted MNPI.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is Kinexys?,The rebrand of JP Morgan's blockchain unit (formerly Onyx). It represents the strategic shift from experimental to industrial digital assets; focusing on tokenized deposits (JPM Coin) and programmable payments for institutional clients.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,How does JPM Coin (JPMD) differ from a stablecoin (like USDC)?,JPM Coin is a Tokenized Deposit; meaning it is a direct liability of the bank and carries the full weight of JPMC's balance sheet. Stablecoins are asset-backed and carry counterparty risk of the issuer.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the 'Singleness of Money' principle?,The regulatory requirement that a digital token (like JPM Coin) must always be exchangeable at par ($1:$1) with commercial bank money; ensuring fungibility and no fluctuation in value compared to traditional deposits.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is 'LLM Suite'?,JPMC's internal; secure gateway to Large Language Models (like GPT-4). It acts as a walled garden to prevent data leakage; allowing employees to use GenAI for productivity without exposing proprietary code or client data to the public internet.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,Define 'Agentic AI' in the context of JPMC's 2025 strategy.,AI systems that can execute multi-step workflows (e.g. Investigate this alert; query the DB; and draft a SAR) rather than just generating text. It shifts AI from a passive tool to an autonomous digital worker with human supervision.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the 'Paved Road' concept in software delivery?,A set of standardized; pre-approved CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure patterns that automatically inherit the bank's security and compliance controls; allowing developers to deploy code without manual risk board approvals.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What are 'Programmable Payments'?,Using smart contracts to embed logic into a payment. For example 'Release funds ONLY when the digital Bill of Lading is verified.' This collapses reconciliation and payment execution into a single atomic step.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the 'Weekend Trap' that Kinexys helps solve?,Traditional RTGS systems (like Fedwire or Target2) often close on weekends/holidays; trapping liquidity. Kinexys allows institutional clients to move value 24/7/365 on the blockchain ledger.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is MNPI?,Material Non-Public Information. Data that; if disclosed; could affect a company's stock price. Systems handling MNPI usually require hosting on Gaia (Private Cloud) with strict Chinese Wall access controls.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,Why is JPMC extending JPM Coin to public blockchains like Base?,To enable Interoperability. It allows institutional clients to settle transactions on the networks where they are already trading (DeFi/Tokenized Assets) while maintaining the safety and regulatory compliance of Bank Money.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the 'Unified Ledger' concept?,A future state where tokenized deposits (money) and tokenized assets (bonds/equities) reside on the same programmable platform; enabling instant Delivery vs. Payment (DvP) and eliminating settlement risk.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is 'Data Sovereignty' and how does it impact cloud strategy?,The legal requirement that data remains within a specific country's borders (e.g. Saudi Arabia; EU). This often mandates using Gaia local instances or specific AWS regions to ensure data does not physically leave the jurisdiction.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the 'Blast Radius' design principle?,Architecting systems so that a failure in one component (e.g. a payment gateway) is contained and does not cascade to bring down the entire platform. This is often achieved using Bulkhead or Circuit Breaker patterns.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,Why is 'Human-in-the-Loop' (HITL) critical for AI in RegTech?,Regulators require accountability. While AI (like Agentic AI) can draft a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR); a human must review and sign off on it to accept the regulatory liability; as AI cannot be held legally responsible.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is 'Atomic Settlement'?,The simultaneous exchange of assets and payment in a single transaction block. If one side fails; the entire transaction reverts. This eliminates counterparty settlement risk.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the approximate annual technology spend of JP Morgan?,~$17-18 Billion. This massive budget allows JPMC to build proprietary advantages (like Kinexys and Gaia) rather than relying solely on third-party vendors.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the 'Hybrid Cloud' strategy at JPMC?,The strategic use of both Gaia (Private Cloud) for core/sensitive workloads and AWS (Public Cloud) for elastic/customer-facing workloads; optimizing for both security (Gaia) and speed/scale (AWS).

Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What does a 'Self Join' allow you to do in a payments table?","It allows a table to join to itself, which is useful for linking related transactions, such as matching a 'Return' payment (pacs.004) to the original Credit Transfer (pacs.008)."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is a 'Cartesian Product' and why is it dangerous in payment reporting?","It occurs when a join lacks a proper condition, matching every row in Table A with every row in Table B. In payments, this multiplies volumes erroneously (e.g., turning 1 million payments into 1 trillion rows)."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"How does the 'GROUP BY' clause help in STP (Straight Through Processing) analysis?","It allows you to aggregate payments by 'Status' or 'Error Code' to calculate counts and percentages of payments that passed without manual intervention."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What does the 'HAVING' clause do that 'WHERE' cannot?","'HAVING' filters data *after* aggregation (e.g., 'Show me accounts that made more than 10,000 transactions'). 'WHERE' filters rows *before* aggregation."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is the specific use of the ROW_NUMBER() window function in handling duplicate SWIFT messages?","It assigns a rank to duplicates based on timestamp. You can then filter for `RowNumber = 1` to keep only the latest/distinct version of the message."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is an 'Anti-Join' pattern (e.g., LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL) used for in compliance?","It is used to find missing relationships, such as identifying 'Settled Payments' that do NOT have a corresponding record in the 'AML_Screening_Log'."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"Why should you generally avoid 'SELECT *' in a high-volume payment production environment?","It retrieves unnecessary columns, consuming I/O and network bandwidth, and can break application code if the underlying schema changes (e.g., new columns added)."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is a 'Clustered Index' best used for in a Transaction Table?","It physically sorts the data on disk. It is best used on the `SettlementDate` or primary `TransactionID` to optimize range queries (e.g., 'Get all payments for this date')."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What does an 'Execution Plan' tell a Data Engineer?","It reveals how the database engine intends to run a query (e.g., using an Index Seek vs. a Table Scan), helping identify performance bottlenecks."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"Why is 'Table Partitioning' by Date critical for regulatory reporting?","It allows the database to ignore irrelevant historical data (Partition Pruning) when a report only requests data for a specific day or month, speeding up retrieval."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is the main downside of using 'Database Cursors' for reporting?","Cursors process data row-by-row, which is extremely slow compared to set-based SQL operations, especially when aggregating millions of transactions."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is a Stored Procedure?","A pre-compiled collection of SQL statements stored in the database. In payments, they are used to standardize complex logic (like End-of-Day reconciliation) and manage security."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"Define 'Referential Integrity' in the context of a Payment Engine.","The guarantee that relationships between tables remain consistent; for example, you cannot delete a Customer record if there are existing Payments linked to that Customer."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is 'Deadlocking' in a high-concurrency payment system?","A situation where two transactions are blocking each other, each waiting for the other to release a resource (e.g., updating the same Balance row), causing both to freeze or fail."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is a 'Composite Key' in a payment transaction table?","A primary key made up of two or more columns (e.g., `PaymentID` + `VersionNumber`) used to uniquely identify a record when a single column is insufficient."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is the difference between `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE` when clearing a staging table?","`DELETE` removes rows one by one and logs each deletion (slow). `TRUNCATE` deallocates the data pages (fast) and cannot be rolled back as easily."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is a 'Surrogate Key' and why use it over a natural key like IBAN?","A system-generated unique identifier (usually an integer). It is used because natural keys (like IBANs) can change or be recycled, whereas surrogate keys provide permanent stability."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"Explain 'Index Fragmentation' in a high-volume payment system.","It occurs when pages in an index are out of logical order due to frequent inserts/deletes. This forces the database to do more I/O to read the same amount of data, slowing down reports."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is the purpose of the `COALESCE` function in regulatory reporting?","It returns the first non-null value in a list. Useful for providing default values (e.g., `COALESCE(Country, 'UNKNOWN')`) to prevent reports from breaking due to missing data."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is 'Parameter Sniffing' in the context of Stored Procedures?","When the database creates an execution plan based on the first parameter value passed (e.g., a small country), which might be terrible for subsequent runs with different values (e.g., a huge country)."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is a 'View' in a database and how does it aid security?","A virtual table based on a SQL query. It restricts access to specific rows or columns, allowing users to see report data without accessing the raw, sensitive tables."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is the difference between `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` for storing Country Codes?","`CHAR` is fixed-length (padding with spaces), ideal for standard codes like ISO Country Codes (2 chars). `VARCHAR` is variable, better for names or descriptions."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What does 'OLAP' stand for and how does it differ from 'OLTP'?","Online Analytical Processing. It is optimized for complex reading and aggregation (reporting), whereas OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) is optimized for fast, atomic transactions (payments)."
Day1_DB_Concepts_Gemi,"What is a 'Recursive CTE' used for in payments?","It is a Common Table Expression that references itself. Useful for traversing hierarchical data, like finding the ultimate parent company of a debtor."

"Day3_SQL_Scenarios_RegReports_Perp","What does an INNER JOIN between payment and customer tables return in a cross border volume query","It returns only payments where a matching customer row exists so payments with missing customer mappings are excluded from the result set"
"Day3_SQL_Scenarios_RegReports_Perp","What result does a LEFT JOIN from fact_payment to sanctions_hit_fact produce","It returns all payments and adds sanctions hit columns when matches exist otherwise those hit columns are NULL making it suitable for coverage analysis"
