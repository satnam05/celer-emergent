Deck,Question,Answer
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the 'Fortress Balance Sheet' in a technical architecture context?,It translates to Operational Resilience. It dictates that systems must prioritize survival and recovery over cost efficiency; necessitating active-active redundancy to withstand Black Swan events and ensure the bank can settle payments even during a catastrophe.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is 'Gaia' in the JP Morgan ecosystem?,JP Morgan's internal Private Cloud (PaaS) built on Cloud Foundry/Kubernetes. It is used to host core ledgers; high-sensitivity data (MNPI); and applications requiring strict data sovereignty within the firm's firewall.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,When should a Solutions Analyst choose AWS (Public Cloud) over Gaia?,For 'burst' compute needs (e.g. overnight risk simulations); highly elastic workloads; or customer-facing applications that benefit from global edge caching; provided the data is not restricted MNPI.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is Kinexys?,The rebrand of JP Morgan's blockchain unit (formerly Onyx). It represents the strategic shift from experimental to industrial digital assets; focusing on tokenized deposits (JPM Coin) and programmable payments for institutional clients.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,How does JPM Coin (JPMD) differ from a stablecoin (like USDC)?,JPM Coin is a Tokenized Deposit; meaning it is a direct liability of the bank and carries the full weight of JPMC's balance sheet. Stablecoins are asset-backed and carry counterparty risk of the issuer.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the 'Singleness of Money' principle?,The regulatory requirement that a digital token (like JPM Coin) must always be exchangeable at par ($1:$1) with commercial bank money; ensuring fungibility and no fluctuation in value compared to traditional deposits.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is 'LLM Suite'?,JPMC's internal; secure gateway to Large Language Models (like GPT-4). It acts as a walled garden to prevent data leakage; allowing employees to use GenAI for productivity without exposing proprietary code or client data to the public internet.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,Define 'Agentic AI' in the context of JPMC's 2025 strategy.,AI systems that can execute multi-step workflows (e.g. Investigate this alert; query the DB; and draft a SAR) rather than just generating text. It shifts AI from a passive tool to an autonomous digital worker with human supervision.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the 'Paved Road' concept in software delivery?,A set of standardized; pre-approved CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure patterns that automatically inherit the bank's security and compliance controls; allowing developers to deploy code without manual risk board approvals.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What are 'Programmable Payments'?,Using smart contracts to embed logic into a payment. For example 'Release funds ONLY when the digital Bill of Lading is verified.' This collapses reconciliation and payment execution into a single atomic step.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the 'Weekend Trap' that Kinexys helps solve?,Traditional RTGS systems (like Fedwire or Target2) often close on weekends/holidays; trapping liquidity. Kinexys allows institutional clients to move value 24/7/365 on the blockchain ledger.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is MNPI?,Material Non-Public Information. Data that; if disclosed; could affect a company's stock price. Systems handling MNPI usually require hosting on Gaia (Private Cloud) with strict Chinese Wall access controls.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,Why is JPMC extending JPM Coin to public blockchains like Base?,To enable Interoperability. It allows institutional clients to settle transactions on the networks where they are already trading (DeFi/Tokenized Assets) while maintaining the safety and regulatory compliance of Bank Money.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the 'Unified Ledger' concept?,A future state where tokenized deposits (money) and tokenized assets (bonds/equities) reside on the same programmable platform; enabling instant Delivery vs. Payment (DvP) and eliminating settlement risk.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is 'Data Sovereignty' and how does it impact cloud strategy?,The legal requirement that data remains within a specific country's borders (e.g. Saudi Arabia; EU). This often mandates using Gaia local instances or specific AWS regions to ensure data does not physically leave the jurisdiction.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the 'Blast Radius' design principle?,Architecting systems so that a failure in one component (e.g. a payment gateway) is contained and does not cascade to bring down the entire platform. This is often achieved using Bulkhead or Circuit Breaker patterns.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,Why is 'Human-in-the-Loop' (HITL) critical for AI in RegTech?,Regulators require accountability. While AI (like Agentic AI) can draft a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR); a human must review and sign off on it to accept the regulatory liability; as AI cannot be held legally responsible.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is 'Atomic Settlement'?,The simultaneous exchange of assets and payment in a single transaction block. If one side fails; the entire transaction reverts. This eliminates counterparty settlement risk.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the approximate annual technology spend of JP Morgan?,~$17-18 Billion. This massive budget allows JPMC to build proprietary advantages (like Kinexys and Gaia) rather than relying solely on third-party vendors.
Day 1: Strategy Gaia Kinexys & AI,What is the 'Hybrid Cloud' strategy at JPMC?,The strategic use of both Gaia (Private Cloud) for core/sensitive workloads and AWS (Public Cloud) for elastic/customer-facing workloads; optimizing for both security (Gaia) and speed/scale (AWS).
