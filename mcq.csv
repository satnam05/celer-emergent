Day 1 Exam: The JPMC Ecosystem & Technical Strategy,In the context of JPMC's Fortress Balance Sheet philosophy; how does this financial concept translate into a specific Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) for payment system architecture?,Systems must be designed with Fail-Fast logic to immediately reject any transaction that cannot be processed within 50ms to preserve liquidity.,Systems must prioritize Operational Resilience over cost efficiency; mandating active-active multi-region redundancy to survive a complete data center loss without data inconsistency.,Systems must strictly utilize Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocols across all microservices to ensure that the financial ledger never deviates from ACID properties; regardless of latency cost.,Systems must be built on Serverless architecture to ensure that capital expenditure scales linearly with transaction volume; protecting the bank’s operating margin.,B
Day 1 Exam: The JPMC Ecosystem & Technical Strategy,JP Morgan has rebranded its blockchain unit to Kinexys. What is the primary strategic distinction between the JPM Coin (JPMD) token and a standard market stablecoin (like USDC)?,JPMD operates on a public permissionless ledger for retail use; whereas stablecoins are restricted to private institutional networks.,JPMD is a Tokenized Deposit representing a direct liability of the bank; whereas stablecoins are asset-backed instruments carrying counterparty risk of the issuer.,JPMD uses a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism to ensure higher security than the Proof-of-Stake mechanism used by stablecoins.,JPMD is designed solely for internal book transfers between JPMC branches; whereas stablecoins are used for cross-border client payments.,B
Day 1 Exam: The JPMC Ecosystem & Technical Strategy,You are designing a new microservice for Regulatory Reporting that processes Material Non-Public Information (MNPI). According to JPMC’s hybrid cloud strategy; where should this service primarily be deployed?,Public Cloud (AWS) using Confidential Computing instances to encrypt memory; as this offers the highest elasticity for batch reporting.,Gaia (Private Cloud); as JPMC policy typically mandates that high-sensitivity MNPI data and core ledgers remain within the firm's firewall for sovereignty and security.,A multi-cloud mesh (Azure and AWS) to ensure that if one cloud provider is subpoenaed; the data remains fragmented and inaccessible.,The Paved Road AWS environment; provided the S3 buckets are configured with immutable object locking and strict IAM roles.,B
Day 1 Exam: The JPMC Ecosystem & Technical Strategy,JPMC is aggressively adopting Agentic AI for 2025. How does an AI Agent functionally differ from the LLM Suite (GenAI) tools currently available to employees?,LLM Suite generates text/code based on prompts; whereas an AI Agent can autonomously plan; execute multi-step workflows (e.g. query DB; draft SAR; email outcomes); and use tools.,LLM Suite is hosted on the public internet; whereas AI Agents are hosted strictly on Gaia Private Cloud.,LLM Suite is used for back-office operations; whereas AI Agents are customer-facing chatbots used in the Chase mobile app.,LLM Suite uses probabilistic models; whereas AI Agents use deterministic If-This-Then-That logic exclusively.,A
Day 1 Exam: The JPMC Ecosystem & Technical Strategy,Regarding ISO 20022 and the 2025/2026 roadmap; what is the specific operational risk associated with Data Truncation that a Solutions Analyst must mitigate?,The risk that sending an ISO 20022 message to a legacy MT-based system will result in the XML header being rejected by the SWIFT network.,The risk that rich data (e.g. Ultimate Debtor) in an incoming MX message is dropped when passed through an internal legacy system; leading to sanctions screening failures downstream.,The risk that the XML message size exceeds the 10kb limit of legacy mainframes; causing the payment to crash the settlement engine.,The risk that the UETR (Unique End-to-End Transaction Reference) is regenerated by the legacy system; breaking the audit trail.,B

Day 1 Exam: The JPMC Ecosystem & Technical Strategy,You are analyzing a requirement for Inbound Transaction Monitoring (ITM). Why has this become a priority for UK Payment architectures in 2025?,Because the Bank of England now charges a fee for every inbound payment that is not screened.,Because new PSR rules mandate 50/50 liability split for APP Fraud; forcing banks to detect if their own customer is a mule receiving stolen funds.,Because ISO 20022 does not support outbound monitoring; shifting the burden to the receiving bank.,Because GDPR prevents banks from monitoring outbound payments due to data privacy concerns.,B
Day 1 Exam: The JPMC Ecosystem & Technical Strategy,What is the primary function of the LLM Suite within the JPMC technology ecosystem?,A customer-facing chatbot that replaces human support agents for mortgage applications.,An internal; secured gateway to models like GPT-4; ensuring that proprietary bank data is not trained on or leaked to public model providers.,A suite of open-source Low-Level Machine code compilers used to optimize the Gaia private cloud.,A regulatory reporting tool that automatically generates SARs without human intervention.,B

Day 1 Exam: The JPMC Ecosystem & Technical Strategy,Why is Data Sovereignty a critical constraint for a Lead Solutions Analyst covering the EMEA region?,It requires that all European payment data be stored on servers physically located within the EU; preventing the use of US-only cloud regions for certain datasets.,It means that the data belongs to the Queen/Crown and cannot be owned by a private bank.,It mandates that all data must be open-source and accessible to the public under GDPR.,It requires that data processing power must be equally distributed across all EU member states.,A
Day 1 Exam: The JPMC Ecosystem & Technical Strategy,In the context of Agentic AI; what does Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) governance entail for Financial Crime?,Humans must manually type every SAR report; with AI only allowed to check spelling.,AI Agents can draft investigations and recommend outcomes; but a human investigator must explicitly review and sign off before a SAR is filed with the NCA.,AI Agents are strictly forbidden from accessing production data; humans must feed them data via CSV files.,Humans must monitor the electricity consumption of the AI data centers to ensure sustainability.,B
